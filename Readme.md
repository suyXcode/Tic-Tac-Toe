## 🧩 About the Game

Tic Tac Toe (also known as *noughts and crosses*) is a classic strategy game played on a 3×3 grid. Two players take turns placing marks — **X** and **O** — and the first player to get three in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

This web version lets two players play locally on the same screen. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
